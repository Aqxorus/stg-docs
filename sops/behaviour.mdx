### STG Behaviour Expectations

STG officers represent the pinnacle of tactical capability. Officers must:

STG operates under a two-strike system:

**Strike 1:**

- 2-week stand down from all STG activity.
- Return only after Command review.

**Strike 2:**

- Immediate dismissal from STG.
- 6-month stand down before reapplication.
- Strike 1 will remain on your record for 3 months, if no further complaints or action it will be removed.

**Leadership Authority**

### Activity

While STG Leadership understands that there is real life outside of ERLC and people have IRL commitments there is an expectation of a certain level of activity.

While there is no perfect metric to base activity on the following will be used to judge your level of activity.

- Post deployment logs.
- Reactions to pages.

**STG Leadership holds all discretion in regards to warnings and dismissal from STG**
