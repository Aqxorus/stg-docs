### STG Vehicles

Special Tactics Group (STG) vehicles are purpose-built to support high-risk police operations. Their primary purpose is to transport STG officers, specialised equipment, and tactical resources safely and efficiently to critical incidents. These vehicles are designed for rapid deployment, enhanced protection, and operational versatility, allowing STG teams to respond effectively to situations such as armed offenders, hostage events, counter-terrorism operations, and other serious threats to public safety.

**Rules and Policy around using STG vehicles**

- Vehicles must only be used at a page, unless directed otherwise by STG Command.
- Vehicles include the armoured SUVs/Utes, unmarked response vehicles or any covert vehicles.
